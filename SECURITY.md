# Security Policy

this jawn is protected by mother earth and a few aliens.

following the law is smart.
be smart.
no consequences if smart.
they apply to people.

if you do wrong,
no matter how smartly,
you're not smart. 
as you may face consequences.

so be smart.
follow the law.
don't abuse.
but have fun!!!
